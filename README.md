# An-Analysis-of-Flight-Delay-in-the-US
 - **Overview:** This project analyzes flight delays in the US using data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) from 2015 to 2020. It identifies major 
                 causes of flight delays and their impacts on airline performance. The project employs descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and regression 
                 analysis to explore how weather conditions, airline size, and airport congestion influence flight delays.
 - **Technologies Used:** Excel and Tableau for Descriptive statistics and regression analysis Tableau for Data visualization tools for showcasing results Excel and 
                          statistical software for data manipulation and analysis
 - **What I Learned:** I gained insights into the complexities of airline operation logistics and the external factors affecting them. I developed skills in data 
                       cleaning, data analysis, and the application of statistical methods to real-world problems. This project also enhanced my ability to interpret 
                       analytical results into actionable business strategies.
